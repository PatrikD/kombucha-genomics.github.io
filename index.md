## __About__

Kombucha Genomics is a collaborative citizen science effort working to gain a better understanding of everyone's favorite vinegar-y beverage - Kombucha! Kombucha is a fermented beverage made from a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast(SCOBY). A SCOBY takes a mixture of black tea and sugar, degrades the sugars through anaerobic fermentation, and ultimately turns it into a refreshing beverage.

We're working to learn as much as we can about the micro-organism masterminds behind this delicious and ancient drink. Some of our next steps include: ribosomal sequencing of SCOBY micro-organisms, isolation of particular yeast and bacterial strains, and organizing classes to introduce community members to our work and the biological sciences.
